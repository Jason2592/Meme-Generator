# Meme-Generator

This is a small project I made in my second semester of the freshman year.
 The purpose of the project is to let the user create their own meme images with our built database.
 Users can add any kinds of texts on anywhere of the image.
 We also allowed users to create memes by using images on the internet.
 When the instructor implyed that the form of the object must contain the usage of the database, I immediatly came up with this idea.
