# Meme-Generator

This is a small project I made for my OOP course in the second semester of the freshman year.
 The purpose of the project is to let the user create their own meme images with our built database.
 Users can add any kinds of texts on anywhere of the image.
 We also allowed users to create memes by using images on the internet.
 
 The main method is in loginFrame.java.
